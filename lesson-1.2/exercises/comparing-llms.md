# Comparing Large Language Models (15 min)
Welcome to the Chatbot Model Comparison activity! Here, you will compare the output of three different chatbot models. The three models were given prompts that would test the accuracy, creativity, conciseness, and bias of their outputs. Your job is to select the model that performed best in each category. Let's get started!

Complete the activity [here](https://igfnaqfcyl-13589482-i.codehs.me/index.html).  Then edit this page and write down your reflections here:

### Which model did you find performed best overall, and why?
[Model C is the model that preformed best overall because it answered the question with details that relate to the prompt. The other models answered but not as well because they gave more details unrelated to the prompt. C was also accurate. ]

### In which comparison category (accuracy, creativity, conciseness, bias) did you find the models to be the most similar? What about the most different?
[I believe that they were the most similar in accuracy because they had the same answers. Although I think that they were different in creativity because the models all gave answers in different ways.]

### Were you surprised by any of the results?
[I was suprised that AI could all sound like a different person wrote it. ]

### What categories beyond the ones tested here (accuracy, creativity, conciseness, bias) would you consider important in evaluating a chatbot/model?
[I believe that a category tha could be included is how detailed it is.]
